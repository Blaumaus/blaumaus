## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m a frontend & mobile engineer, working on FOSS and paid projects.\
My main area of expertise is web (react.js / nest.js), mobile (react native) and low-level (c/c++, masm) programming & reverse engineering.\
Also, I'm interested in anything related to computer science in general (and in any other non-computer-related topics).
- 💫 The creator of [https://swetrix.com](https://swetrix.com/?ref=gh-main-page), [https://lechiffre.now.sh](https://lechiffre.now.sh/?ref=gh-main-page).
- 🍁 I’m looking to collaborate on any exciting opensource (and also private, hehe) projects!
