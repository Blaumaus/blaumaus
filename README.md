## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a fullstack web/c++ developer, working on FOSS and paid projects.\
My main area of expertise is web (node.js, react, js, pentesting) and low-level (c/cpp, masm, RE) programming.\
Also I'm interested in anything related to computer science in general (and im many other non-computer-related topics).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any exciting opensource projects!
