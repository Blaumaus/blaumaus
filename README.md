## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a frontend & mobile engineer, working on FOSS and paid projects.\
My main area of expertise is web (react.js / nest.js), mobile (react native) and low-level (c/c++, masm) programming & reverse engineering.\
Also I'm interested in anything related to computer science in general (and in any other non-computer-related topics).
